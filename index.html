<font size="4">
<ol type="1">
<li style="color:none"> If a is any number and n is an integer, then a^n = a*a*a........ multiplied n times, where a is base, n the exponent of a^n is read <br> as "a to  the power of n".</li>
<br>
<li style="color:none"> Power 2 = SQUARE and Power 3 = CUBE ,i.e a^2 is read as "a square", a^3 is read as "a cube".</li>
<br>
<li style="color:none"> Power of (-1) <br> (i) (-1)^ 2 = 1 <br> (ii) (-1) ^ 3 = -1 <br> If -1 is raised to the power of an even number its result is 1, Else its result is -1 </li>
<br>
<li style="color:none"> Laws of Exponents <br>  Law 1: a^m x a^n = a^m+n <br> Law 2: a^m / a^n = a^m-n <br> Law 3: a^0 = 1 <br> Law 4: a^-n = 1/a^n </li>
<br>
<li style="color:none"> Squares <br> (i) If a number is multiplied by itself, the product so obtained is called the square of that number. <br> (ii) Squares of even numbers are always even, Squares of odd numbers are always odd <br> (iii) Perfect Squares : 1,4,9,16,25,36 are squares of natural numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6 respectively, Such numbers are called perfect squares. <br> (iv) The units place in square numbers is not occupied by the digit 2,3,7 or 8. <br> (v) The number of zeroes at the end of a square number is double the number of zeroes at the end of a given number, i.e., the number of zeroes at the end of a perfect square is always even.</li>
<br>
<li style="color:none"> Square roots <br> The square root of a possitive integer n is an integer whose square is n. <br> For example: 4 is the square of 2, 2 is the square root of 4</li> 
<br>
<li style="color:none"> Cubes <br>(i) The number obtained on multiplying a given number by itself three times is called the cube of the given number e.g., 6^3 = 6*6*6 = 216;</li>
<br>
<li style="color:none"> Cube root <br> (i) Cube root of a number is that number when multiplied itself three times gives the original number. Example: 3 is the cube root of 216. </li>
